# PGN to CSV Chess Parser

This repository contains code that can be used to parse a PGN formatted chess file from either chess.com or lichess.org into a CSV formatted file.

#### Update:
I have used this script to parse my own chess games from chess.com and I am in the process of performing an anlaysis of my games in R. I will share the anlaysis here shortly.
